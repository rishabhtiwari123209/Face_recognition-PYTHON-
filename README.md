#Face Recognition in Python
Face detection is the process of recognizing human faces in images or videos. This is a rapidly expanding field of computer vision with many useful applications such as security, facial recognition and image analysis.


There are many ways to write facial recognition in Python using different libraries and frameworks. Some of the most popular libraries and frameworks are:

#OpenCV:
OpenCV is an open source computer vision software that can be used to detect faces in images and videos.
It provides a pre-trained graded classifier for face detection right out of the box.
#Dlib: 
Dlib is a machine learning library that can be used for tasks such as face detection. It provides a benchmark for face detection that can be used to identify faces in photos and videos.

Face_recognition:
face_recognition is a python library that provides an easy-to-use interface for face detection and recognition. dlib uses a modern face recognition system built with a deep learning library.
